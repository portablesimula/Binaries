This directory contains a Simula System ready for use. 

You may download or map it to your own file system.

Suppose <git> is the super directory into which you put the 'Binaries'
then you should have a directory tree like this:

  <git>
        - Binaries
              - Release-Beta-02
                    - rts
                             ....
                    - tst
                             ....
                    - simula.jar
                    - ReleaseNotes.txt
                    - RunCompilerTest.bat
                    - RunCompilerTest.sh

You should set the environment-variable  SIMULA_HOME = <git>/Binaries

Then you can run RunCompilerTest.bat or .sh depending on your operating system.

Deviations from 'Simula Standard'

The current version of this SIMULA system differs from the Simula Standard in some areas.
Following the chapters of  Simula Standard, this is a complete list:

4   Virtual labels are not fully implemented. In certain rare cases goto such
    labels may result in Runtime errors.

6   External non-SIMULA procedures are NOT IMPLEMENTED.

9   The name specified parameter to the random drawing procedures is not used. 
    Instead, the default seed in the Java Library is used.

    This is not a real deviation since Simula Standard says BasicDrawing is
    implementation defined.

    The <real-type> parameter to the 'histd' procedure must be type real.
    
10  The File procedure setaccess is not implemented
